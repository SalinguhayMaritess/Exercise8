<h1> 10 Signs that he’s genuine. </h1>
<center><p>1. He doesn’t judge
<br>A guy who is genuine is respectful of everyone. He doesn’t judge other people’s life choices or backgrounds. He doesn’t discriminate or hold unfair bias. A person who has genuine feelings for you will not care about your imperfections because he sees you for who you are. <br>
<br>
<br>2. He is loyal
<br>Loyalty means he stands up for you and supports you. A genuine person doesn’t leave you in the dust when things get hard, he is there through thick and thin. He fights for you and isn’t afraid for people to know that. Most importantly, he does not date any other girls if he’s serious about you. He will be transparent about who he’s talking to.<br>
<br>
<br>3. He admits he isn’t perfect.
<br>A non genuine person will lie about his imperfections. He will tell you how successful he is or what he does for a living when none of those things are true. A genuine individual is more likely to reveal his weaknesses, so you can make accurate decisions about whether this person right for you or not. Furthermore, admitting your imperfections is a reflection of a mature individual.<br>
<br>
<br>4. He doesn’t talk behind your back
<br>A guy who talks about you to his friends as soon as you leave is not someone who means what he says. A genuine person speaks his mind and doesn’t hold comments to share with others about when you’re not there. This is the same for friendship as well. A genuine friend will not talk bad things about their friends behind their back. If you see that he talks down about one of his own friends for the purpose of looking them down, then that’s a red flag.<br>
<br>
<br>5. He doesn’t gossip
<br>This goes with the last point, gossip is a sign of someone who is not secure and enjoys spreading rumors. Gossip is often hurtful and if a guy refrains from gossip is upfront with his thoughts and doesn’t hide his feelings. Furthermore, it’s a big red flag if he does gossip because it means he will share secrets or private things between you guys with others.<br>
<br>
<br>6. He is close to his family
<br>Family relationships are key to knowing whether a person in genuine. If a guy has a great relationship with his family, it means he is a great guy all the time – at home and with others.<br>
<br>
<br>7. He includes you in everything
<br>A guy who ignores you or doesn’t want to include you into his life has ulterior motives. Making you a part of his life shows that he is proud of you and wants more out of the relationship.<br>
<br>
<br>8. He is there as an emotional support
<br>Being someone’s emotional support is a huge responsibility. A guy who can do that for you means he not only knows you very well but he is always there for you.<br>
<br>
<br>9. He is consistent
<br>This is like the a previous point, except it goes further and means that a guy follows through with his promises. This a sign of a genuine person who makes sure that if he says he’s going to do something, he will do it.<br>
<br>
<br>10. He takes things slow
<br>Sometimes a fake guy will take you on a whirlwind romance but it never lasts. A genuine guy will take things slow and get to know you over time instead of rushing into things.</p></center>
<h1> Dear girl who's been replaced, </h1>
	<center> <p> Just because he's already with a new girl, that doesn't mean you should feel like you've been replaced because the truth is it's impossible to replace you. He might think she's prettier than you, he might think her personality is better than yours, and he might think he's more compatible with that girl than he was with you, but don't let him take away how special you are in your own way, how unique you are in your own right, and how amazing you are in your own light. You shouldn't look at her and feel ugly, you shouldn't compare yourself to her and feel like you aren't good enough, and you shouldn't see how he loves her and hate yourself for it. He might not be able to see what you're worth, but you should know what you worth. He might not be able to recognize your value, but you should be able to recognize what your value is. He might not be able to realize what you deserve, but you should be able to give yourself what you deserve. Sure, he's already with another girl, but that doesn't mean you have to already be with another guy, too. Right now is the time for you to find yourself and pick up the pieces of yourself that were left broken by him. You don't need to be worrying about guys, let alone one who doesn't care about you anymore. I know you're feeling vulnerable, but don't be so quick to fall for the next guy who's there for you because you aren't ready to be with someone at the moment. If he's already happy because of another girl, good for him. He's no longer your problem. He's her problem. Let her deal with what kind of guy he truly is when she eventually finds out. Just focus on yourself, do you, and eventually you'll be the reason why you're happy.
